  <h1>Privacy Policy – Blockit</h1>
  <p>Last updated: [DATE]</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Blockit (the “App”) collects, uses, and
    protects information when you use the App.
  </p>

  <p>
    Blockit is operated by an independent developer (“we,” “us,” or “our”).
    Contact: contact@blockit.app
  </p>

  <h2>Quick Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Exercise detection is processed locally on your device.</li>
    <li>We do not record, store, or upload camera images or videos.</li>
    <li>App blocking and restrictions are enforced locally on your device.</li>
    <li>We do not sell your personal data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>On-device processing:</strong> Blockit uses your device camera to
    analyze movements for exercise repetition counting (such as push-ups). This
    processing is performed locally on your device. Raw camera frames or videos
    are not stored or transmitted by us.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Usage and diagnostics:</strong> We may collect limited, non-identifying
    usage and diagnostic information (such as app version, device type, or crash
    logs) to improve performance and stability.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Subscription information:</strong> Purchase status and subscription
    information are provided by Apple in order to verify access to premium
    features. We do not have access to your payment details.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Support communications:</strong> If you contact us, we may collect the
    information you choose to provide.
  </p>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Information may be shared only with Apple
    as necessary for subscription management, or when required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to operate the App.
    Exercise motion data used for repetition counting is not stored as raw camera
    or video content.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect
    information, but no method of storage or transmission is completely secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

    Blockit is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
    collect personal data from children under 13.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the App
    after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.
