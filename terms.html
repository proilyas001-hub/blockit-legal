  <h1>Terms of Service – Blockit</h1>
  <p>Last updated: [DATE]</p>

  <p>
    These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Blockit mobile
    application (the “App”). By using the App, you agree to these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    Blockit is operated by an independent developer. Contact:
    contact@blockit.app
  </p>

  <h2>Eligibility</h2>
  <p>
    You must be at least 13 years old to use the App. If you are under 18, you
    must have permission from a parent or legal guardian.
  </p>

  <h2>Description of the Service</h2>
  <p>
    Blockit encourages physical activity by restricting access to certain
    applications until the user completes a physical exercise. The App uses the
    device camera for movement analysis, processed locally on the device.
  </p>

  <h2>User Responsibility & Health Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not provide medical advice. You use the App at your own risk.
    Consult a healthcare professional before starting any physical activity.
  </p>

  <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>
    Some features require a paid subscription. Subscriptions renew automatically
    unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.
    Billing and cancellations are handled by Apple via the App Store.
  </p>

  <h2>License and Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>
    You are granted a limited, personal, non-transferable license to use the App
    for lawful purposes only. You may not reverse engineer or misuse the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>
    The App is provided “as is” without guarantees of uninterrupted availability
    or specific results.
  </p>

  <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the
    amount you paid for the App in the three (3) months preceding the claim.
  </p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate access if these Terms are violated.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>
    Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of
    the updated Terms.
